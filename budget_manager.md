# Budget Manager Ideas

1. **Digital-First Ad Strategy**
   - Focus budget on targeted digital ads (Google, Facebook, Instagram) for high ROI.
   - *Rationale*: Cost-effective, measurable performance, precise targeting minimizes waste.

2. **Partnerships with Local Influencers**
   - Allocate budget to smaller, local influencers in health/wellness and skincare.
   - *Rationale*: Lower cost per engagement, high credibility, effective regional targeting.

3. **Seasonal Bundle Promotions**
   - Budget for promotional product bundles during peak (holiday, back-to-school) periods.
   - *Rationale*: Boosts average transaction value, increases short-term sales, leverages existing fixed costs.
